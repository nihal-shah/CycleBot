<!-- ROUGH ANALYSIS AND REPLACEMENT FORCED BY GOOGLE (MAIN PY FILE):  The issue arises from a syntax error in one line on mainpy file, specifically at this part "print(t)", as it is not recognized by Python. The correct function call should be: print("Hello World"). This change will allow the code to run without errors and display 'Hello World' instead of returning an unexpected NoneType object that may cause further problems in execution due missing dependencies or imports on top level, etc..  -->
